SS# StyleMate Project

StyleMate is a React + Vite application designed to make it simple to organize a digital wardrobe and build outfits from saved items. The app focuses on a clean, practical flow where users can add clothing pieces, review what they have, and experiment with different outfit combinations without leaving the interface. It is intended as a lightweight front-end experience that helps users keep track of their style essentials, reduce decision fatigue, and plan looks more quickly for daily use or special occasions.
